# a project for front-end development for an agency website

I want to test my front-end development skills and styling to achieve better techniques for website appearances.

## current techniques I wanna apply

### front-end
- a collapsible menu nav
- a custom video player 
- a carousel of images
- cool hover effects on cards
- some cool charts from chart.js


## tech stack
- vanilla HTML
- SCSS -> compiled to CSS
- vanilla JS 
- deployed using GitHub Pages

But my furture plans, i may convert this project to a React app
