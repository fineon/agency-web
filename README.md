# A project for front-end development for an agency website

I want to test my front-end development skills and styling to achieve better techniques for website appearances.

## What i learned
- creating that fancy banner that has skewed lines to create a dynamic look on a website (which most websites do in 2021)
- made a fancy title highlighter using div. I'm happy with how it looks and behave 
- played around with the image + background header and clip-path in CSS. It gave me more control in shaping images and background into different shapes. Good for adapting to designs with dynamic shapes

- clip-path polygon path navigation: ```X (horizontal) & Y (vertical)``` axis: ```clip-path: polygon(0->X 0->Y, 0->X 100%->Y, 100%->X 0->Y);```

## Tech stack
- vanilla HTML
- SCSS -> compiled to CSS
- vanilla JS 
- deployed using GitHub Pages

For furture plans, i may convert this project to a React app o other dynamic scripting app for funtionalities

## Current techniques I wanna apply

### Front-end
- a collapsible menu nav
- a custom video player 
- a carousel of images
- cool hover effects on cards
- some cool charts from chart.js
